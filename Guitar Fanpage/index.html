                        The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings. It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings with either a guitar pick or the finger(s)/fingernails of one hand, while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker.
                        The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.
                        There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), the steel-string acoustic guitar, and the archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar.
                        Electric guitars, introduced in the 1930s, use an amplifier and a loudspeaker that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear, and, given that it produces an electric signal when played, that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using an equalizer (e.g., bass and treble tone controls) and a huge variety of electronic effects units, the most commonly used ones being distortion (or "overdrive") and reverb. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but solid wood guitars began to dominate during the 1960s and 1970s, as they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback "howls". As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music.
                        The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock. The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and many forms of pop.

                            The Fender Stratocaster is a model of electric guitar designed in 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton,
                             and Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster from 
                             1954 to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top "horn" shape for balance. Along with the 
                             Gibson Les Paul and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes. 
                            "Stratocaster" and "Strat" are trademark terms belonging to Fender. Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster by other
                             manufacturers are usually called S-Type or ST-type guitars.
                            The Stratocaster is a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including 
                            country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, punk, and heavy metal.

                            The Fender Telecaster, colloquially known as the Tele /ˈtɛli/, is the world's first commercially successful 
                            solid-body electric guitar. Its simple yet effective design and revolutionary sound broke ground and set trends 
                            in electric guitar manufacturing and popular music. Introduced for national distribution as the Broadcaster in 
                            the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in 
                            continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.
                            Just like the Fender Stratocaster, the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music 
                            and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, 
                            jazz, punk, and heavy metal.

                            Yamaha's NX range was launched back in 2009 in two flavours. The NCX has the wider classical-style neck, flat 
                            fingerboard and 12 frets to the body, while the NTX has a narrower neck, a radius'd 'board and 14 frets to the body.
                            This C version adds a cedar top. The contemporary construction is crisp and faultless, while the dot position markers
                            and a slimmer neck will help those crossing over from a traditional acoustic. From its balanced acoustic sound -
                            quite subdued in terms of volume - to its amplified tone, Yamaha really has got this right. There's a natural sound 
                            with no piezo quack, which records well into your DAW; it loves modern effects, too, and hey, you wanna play it with 
                            a pick like Rodrigo (who uses a custom-made version of this very guitar), be our guest.

                            Ibanez (アイバニーズ Aibanīzu) is a Japanese guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki.[1] Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, 
                            Hoshino Gakki were one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant foothold in import 
                            guitar sales in the United States and Europe, as well as the first brand of guitars to mass-produce the seven-string 
                            guitar and eight-string guitar. Ibanez manufactures effects, accessories, amps, and instruments in Japan, China, 
                            Indonesia and in the United States (at a Los Angeles-based custom shop). As of 2017 they marketed nearly 165 models of 
                            bass guitar, 130 acoustic guitars, and more than 300 electric guitars.

                                The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952.[1] The Les Paul was designed by Gibson president Ted McCarty, 
                                factory manager John Huis and their team, with some input from, and endorsement by, guitarist Les Paul. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple 
                                top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.
                                The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. The sunburst 1958–1960 Les Paul
                                – today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world – was considered a failure,[citation needed] with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what 
                                is now known as the Gibson SG. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has been produced in many versions and editions since.
